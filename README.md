# Datapoints-Perspectives
This is the development site for my personal webpage where I share my software and thoughts on data analysis. 

Checkout my website here:
https://rhalenathomas.github.io/Datapoints-Perspectives/index.html

I am formatting the website in html and you can see all my documents here. 
The site is hosted and deployed with gitpages. 
Any github repo can be used to make a "site".  
Feel free to use my html and style.css as templates to get started.
