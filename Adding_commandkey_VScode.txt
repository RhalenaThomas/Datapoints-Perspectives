Adding a command key in VScode

Ctrl + K, Ctrl + S : should open File - Preference - Keyboard Shortcuts (which doesn't exist in the menu) - does nothing 


type in help : "keyboard shortcuts"  

this allows opening up the keyboard shortcuts - in my current version of VScode : the "Code" menu, settings, keyboard shortcuts

search for 

workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText

hover your mouse on the left where you will see a pencil icon - click this and enter a key combination.  Press enter to save

You must enter a key combination that doesn't exist: I used Ctrl + Option + I
Another suggestion is CTRL + Option + R
